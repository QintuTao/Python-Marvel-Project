# Python-Marvel-Project
A project that uses the official marvel API. 

<hr>

<h2>Stage One: Defining and Idealing</h2>
Since recently I read about an article talking about the marvel's official API and I thought that is interesting. I am expecting myself to build a software that allows users to look up any marvel-related info. Although I am not a marvel person at all, I would love to give this comic API a try. 

Any People who are interested in the large universe created by Marvel would be a potential user of this software. Some possible negative consequence is that this can be a story spoiler. 

This project is meant to be build mainly in Python 3 and the Marvel API; however, some other techniques and software may be needed during the production. 

Some potential difficulties could be the convinience of this software. I will add an User Interface(UI) in it, but whether it actually gives the users a good feel depends on its design and functionality.

The Project is expected to be build primarily by using PyCharm on a Mac, and git will be used as a version control tool.
